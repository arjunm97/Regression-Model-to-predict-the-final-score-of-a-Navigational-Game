# Regression Model to Predict the final score

The aim of the project was to conduct exploratory data analysis and build a regression model which predicts the final score from the 1st level score.

Researchers from UCL conducted research on how spatial ability varies across different socio-economic backgrounds. 
They created a game called sea hero quest to test navigational ability. Another game city hero quest was created to test navigational ability in a different environment. 
The aim of the project was to find insights into playerâ€™s performance in the city hero quest and compare the results to UCL research. 
After conducting exploratory data analysis on the data a regression model was built to predict the final score of a player based on the performance in the 1st round of the game.
A prediction model was also built using a decision tree and the results were compared to the regression model.
